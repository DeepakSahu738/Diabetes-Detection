# Diabetes-Detection

This is the machine learning project that i had made is of comparing two of the most used mechine learning models.
1.Back propogation neural network.
2.fuzzy logic.
I am getting acctracuy of 92.4 % in back propogation neural network and accuracy of 96.3 % in fuzzy logic.

Working functions.

I have trained this model on pima diabeties data set in which i am getting the input of various human health indexes i.e pragnency,blood pressure,glucodse etc.modle will train on that.
